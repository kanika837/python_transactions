This project focuses on everyday household items, detailing when and how these items were purchased. It showcases purchases made by various types of customers.

The project uses bar graphs to display:
 * Categories: What kinds of items were bought.
 * Modes: How the items were purchased.
   
Further analysis in the project chain uses bar graphs to show all sub-categories. The entire data set has been analyzed using box plots, scatter charts, and pie charts. After this data analysis, the project also reflects on and presents ways to optimize these types of transactions.
